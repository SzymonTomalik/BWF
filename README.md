Bet With Friends - my final project in CodersLab programming school.

status:
project passed successfully, all requirements have been met.
but I want to constantly develop it to make it a valuable and accessible application in the future.


It will be an application that will allow you to create groups of users who compete for the title of the best football match tipster.

The application will use an external Football-Data api (https://www.football-data.org)
